# Cricket-Management-System-SQL
Using mySQL and python to create an efficient system to manage the data of cricket players
The aim of this project is to provide complete end-to-end information about cricket players like their batting/bowling averages, match history, experience and achievements along with their personal details. A database management system is created with tables with player specific fields and attributes like runs scored, wickets taken, strike rates, economy, nationality and career-best figures. Using SQL, we query and arrive at our desired result through the following process: 


●	The user is taken through a menu-driven program where he/she has to pick specifics that might interest them in a good player 
●	After taking all of the user’s choices (mentioned previously) into consideration, a list of most suited national or international players is shortlisted and the user is notified 
●	The user can also take a look at the statistics and performance of any player in the pool and can then base his decision to whether or not pick that player for his use case
